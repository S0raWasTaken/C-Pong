# C-Pong
Some pong game I made with Raylib, as a project to learn a bit of C.

### Compiling from source
For Linux check out https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux. You may need to tweak ![CMakeLists.txt](/CMakeLists.txt) to make it work if you're using CMake.

On Windows I'm using `vcpkg` with `CMake`, so you'll need to change ![this lines](https://github.com/S0raWasTaken/C-Pong/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L4L5) to work with your installation of `vcpkg`

But to be honest, just grab a [release](https://github.com/S0raWasTaken/C-Pong/releases/latest), it's that much simpler.
